- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a researcher and educator in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/ "ECE") at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/ "ISU"). Iâ€™m interested in all things data storage (e.g., file systems, non-volatile memories, key-value stores, data-intensive computing, data-centric infrastructures).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m leading the [Data Storage Lab (DSL)](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~mai/lab/dsl.html "Data Storage Lab") where we play with the latest storage technologies and strive to advance the robustness, trustworthiness, scalability, usability etc for data, for people, or just for fun.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m always looking for self-motivated & intellectually strong students who are curious about how computer systems work and are interested in improving the design, implementation, evaluation, and/or application of various systems for data storage.
- ðŸ“« [Contact me](mailto:mai@iastate.edu) if interested in joining DSL!
